# Korean SynthV dictionaries
Korean dictionaries for SynthV voicebanks.

## How to use

The dictionary entries are romanized, although there might be future hangul input as well. *It's advised to phoneme edit accordingly rather than plug-and-play.*

For consonants like "pp/bb", "kk/gg", "tt/dd", "jj", and "ss" it's recommended you increase the phoneme strength as well.

The ANY2KOR dictionary has all other 4 dictionaries combined; to use English phonemes add a 2 to the end, for Mandarin phonemes add a 3, for Cantonese phonemes add a 4, and for Spanish phonemes add a 5. Remember to change the note's language before typing the number in.

Please note this dictionary was made with AI voicebanks in mind, so it might be faulty for Standard voicebanks. (Again, I'll also consider adding support for this if needed.)

Also, credit isn't necessary, I don't really mind; but if you'd like to, feel free to link back or tag me on my socials (latticenail on SoundCloud, MONETWAV on Twitter, NAVI256 on YouTube) so I can see what you've done ^_^
## Notes
* Includes individual ending consonants (i.e. k, ng, l). Uppercase aliases are included too
* Includes syllables starting with "f", "v", "th", "rr", and "z"
